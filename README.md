# Final-Project

I started this project with given JSON file which is four part each contain 50k rows totally 200k rows

Initially i loaded JSONfile to Excel sheet for further Cleaning and preprocessing dataset

Then i checked for Duplicate values, Removed zero value rows, change the datatype for Datetime column

Then i Pushed the clean well structured dataset to Postgresql.

After then i write Query for demanded analytical question and got output according to the requirement.

Then i make connection between the postgresql Uber_dataset to visualization tool Power BI

In power BI tool out of 10 analytical question i gained insight from 8 question,remaining 2 question i extract insight from postgresql query output.

After all visualizations done I generate the report aggregating all output from process of entire project.
